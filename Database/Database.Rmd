# Maintaining a database
[R-trader and databases](http://www.thertrader.com/2015/12/13/maintaining-a-database-of-price-files-in-r/).  This is based on one csv file per instrument. 

## Initial download
There are a list of R files

* listOfInstruments.R
* historicalData.R

## Updating existing data
* updateData.R

Remember to add something to avoid the over-write (as identified by commentator)
